  <b> The PS2 SDK, from the future of today... One line at a time.</b>
</p>

*PS2SDK*, the popular project for developing homebrew for PS2, is ***faulty at core***. With a *GNU* Toolchain from **17 years** ago, scattered documentation, and examples that barely work, I decided it is time I take this matter into my own hands... ***ps2kit*** embelishes the developer with an easier setup, updated tools, and full documentation, so that instead of fighting against it, you'll become as friends.

*ps2kit* is still in very early stages. There is not even a toolchain to build currently.

* Full MIPS R5900 support? *WIP!*
