  <b> The PS2 SDK, from the future of today... One line at a time.</b>
</p>

*PS2SDK*, the popular project for developing homebrew for PS2, is ***faulty at core***. With a *GNU* Toolchain from **17 years** ago, scattered documentation, examples that barely work, and lack of support for **MSYS2**, I decided it is time I take this matter into my own hands... ***ps2kit*** embelishes the developer with a (slightly) safer setup, updated tools, and full documentation, so that instead of fighting against it, you'll become as friends.

*ps2kit* is still in very early stages, but compilation is already very much possible.

* Full MIPS R5900 support? *YES.*
* Optional C++? *SURE.*
* VU0 Macro Assembly? *CURRENTLY BEING TESTED.*

Have a problem? Something you'd like added? Bring it forward on *issues*! Want to talk directly to me? DM me on twitter @StarPrankster or Unevenmetalic Prankster#9347 on *discord*. I'm active a lot. It worries me!
